# Introduction

Ah yes, the age old battle... REST VS GraphQL! Well, to be honest, both have their place. Currently, one glaring issue with REST APIs if if you have to retrieve multiple sets of complex data from various entities, this means that more often than not you either have to call multiple endpoints, or you create a monstrosity of an endpoint to return the specific data needed in that case.

Either you sit with a whole bunch of round-trips to retrieve data, or you create a specialized endpoint which in a bigger team can sometimes be mutated/changed to the point of being inefficient for its original use. GraphQL attempts to solve this problem by eliminating over-fetching data from the API and gives a simpler way of nesting objects in queries.
