<br>

## What is [Hot Chocolate](https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate)

[Hot Chocolate](https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate) is an open-source GraphQL server for the Microsoft .NET platform that is compliant with the newest GraphQL October 2021 spec + Drafts, which makes Hot Chocolate compatible to all GraphQL compliant clients like Strawberry Shake, Relay, Apollo Client, and various other clients and tools. [Hot Chocolate](https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate) can be used for:

- Stand-alone ASP.NET Core GraphQL Server.
- Serverless Azure Function or Amazon Lambda that serves up a GraphQL server.
- GraphQL Gateway for a federated data graph that pulls all your data sources together to create the one source of truth.

### Banana Cake Pop

[Banana Cake Pop](https://chillicream.com/docs/bananacakepop) is an interface that can be used to view and test any GraphQL server implementations. It works well with Hot Chocolate and any other GraphQL server.

This would be the GraphQL replacement in some ways for our `swaggerdocs`, but given that we can mix REST and GraphQL together, it is possible to have both documentation sets live alongside one-another.

## Getting Started

This sample application makes use of (and requires that you have it running on your machine);

- The latest .NET 6 (LTS)
- Docker (and docker client)

### Code Setup
